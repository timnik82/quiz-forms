7. B – Balance demand and capacity

8. B – Shared civil-military use

9. B – EUROCONTROL

10. B – General Air Traffic under ICAO rules

________________
True/False Answers (11–15)
   11. True

   12. True

   13. True

   14. True (classes A–G are ICAO standard)

   15. False – Also to aircraft unsure of position or facing emergencies

Advanced Answers (16–20)
      16. CTR vs TMA:
A CTR (Control Zone) extends from the surface around an airport;
A TMA (Terminal Control Area) overlies several CTRs and manages arriving/departing traffic at higher altitudes.

________________
         17. Reason for ASM levels:
Traffic demand, military activity, and weather evolve over time; ASM levels allow planning days in advance (strategic), refining the day before (pre-tactical), and adapting in real time (tactical).

________________
            18. Correct Answer: B — Predictability

________________
               19. CTOT meaning:
A Calculated Take-Off Time used in ATFM to manage departures in periods of high demand; ensures orderly flow and avoids overloading sectors.

________________
                  20. Correct Answer: C — ICAO provides standards; states implement them
